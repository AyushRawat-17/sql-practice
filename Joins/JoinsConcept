Why Join? -

This allow us to query the combined data of two tables if the information is in two different tables.

When to use Join?-

1. Recombine Data "Big Picture" - When the data has been segregated into multiple table we want to get the complete big picture of the data.
2. Data Enrichment "Extra Info" - When we require some extra information from the another table for the final result.
3. Check Existence "Filtering" - We use this to check the existence of the record in the another table for the filtering purpose. Purpose is to not  to combine the data. 

Scenarios for combining table-

1. Matching Data - Data that is common in both the tables.
2. All Data - Data that exist in the one table whole.
3. Unmatched Data - Oposite of the All Data. 

Syntax for JOINS-

SELECT * FROM A [Type] JOIN B ON A.Key = B.Key
